This factory will start Che and clone the repo che-website.

You can start to preview the website after installing all dependencies (launch task 1) and start development mode (launch task 2).

### Commit
You can commit with the Git view or the terminal (with the git container). Create a dedicated branch and a fork if you are not committer.
In any case, you will need to create a Pull Request.

Note that before your contribution can be accepted by the project, you need to electronically sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Eclipse-Contributor-Agreement) (ECA). 

Also, your commit should be signed-off.
For instance, in command line with the `-s` option:
```
$ git commit -s -m "Auto share multiple projects in single job"
```


### Updating the website
Once your PR is merged, we have jobs at https://ci.eclipse.org/che/job/che-website-pipeline/ that will update the site. It may take few hours.


### Che documentation ?
